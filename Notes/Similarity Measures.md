# Similarity Measures
---
* Medical applications often use **similarity measures** for image registration, typically cross-correlation, sum of squared intensity differences, and mutual information.
* An image similarity measure quantifies the degree of similarity between intensity patterns in two images.
* "Selection of similarity metrics that determines the quality of matching between images. The widely used similarity measures [1–3] include Mutual Information (MI), Cross Correlation (CC), Sum of Squared Difference (SSD) and absolute difference"
