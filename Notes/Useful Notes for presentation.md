"The main idea behind the any image registration algorithm is that the sensed image is undergoes the registration algorithm and its pixel coordinates are converted into the reference image pixel coordinates."

Superimpose images

"The fundamental goal of feature extraction is to abstract a huge quantity of information from the original data input and filter out the redundant information, i.e. to filter out the information that is no longer needed."

An image [similarity measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_measure "Similarity measure") quantifies the degree of similarity between intensity patterns in two images.
